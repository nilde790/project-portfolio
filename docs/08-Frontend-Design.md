# Frontend Design

## Folder structure — feature-based organization

Instead of grouping files by type (`components/`, `hooks/`, `services/`), 
the frontend is organized by **feature**: everything related to a 
specific domain concept lives together. This scales better as the 
project grows, since working on "listings" doesn't require jumping 
between multiple top-level folders.

## Routing

| Path                  | Page                  | Auth required |
|------------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| `/`                    | HomePage               | No             |
| `/listings/:id`        | ListingDetailPage      | No             |
| `/listings/new`        | CreateListingPage      | Yes            |
| `/login`               | LoginPage              | No             |
| `/register`            | RegisterPage           | No             |
| `/profile`             | ProfilePage            | Yes            |

Protected routes (requiring auth) are wrapped in a `ProtectedRoute` 
component that checks authentication state and redirects to `/login` 
if the user isn't logged in.

## State management

- **Server state** (data fetched from the API: listings, user profile): 
  managed via **React Query**, handling caching, loading/error states, 
  and automatic refetching after mutations (e.g. after creating a listing)
- **Auth state** (current user, token): managed via **React Context** 
  (`AuthContext`), providing `useAuth()` across the app — kept separate 
  from React Query since it's app-wide session state, not server data 
  to be cached/refetched
- **Local UI state** (form inputs, filters before submission, modals): 
  handled with plain `useState` inside individual components

## API communication

- **Axios** instance configured once in `shared/lib/axios.ts`, with an 
  interceptor that automatically attaches the JWT token (from 
  `AuthContext`) to every outgoing request's `Authorization` header
- Each feature's `api/` folder contains typed functions wrapping Axios 
  calls (e.g. `getListings()`, `createListing()`), consumed by that 
  feature's React Query hooks

## Key components (high level)

- **ListingCard**: compact preview shown in listing grids (homepage, 
  search results)
- **ListingForm**: shared between create and edit listing flows
- **Pagination**: generic component driving `page`/`pageSize` params 
  against `GET /api/listings`
- **ProtectedRoute**: wraps pages requiring authentication
